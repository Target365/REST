## Introduction
The Target365 REST API gives you direct access to our online services like sending and receiving SMS, address lookup and Strex payment transactions. We encourage using our SDK's which provides an appropriate abstraction level for C# development and is officially support by Target365. The SDK's also implements very high security (ECDsaP256 HMAC) compared to the REST API secret key.
* https://github.com/Target365/sdk-for-net
* https://github.com/Target365/sdk-for-java
* https://github.com/Target365/sdk-for-node
* https://github.com/Target365/sdk-for-php
* https://github.com/Target365/sdk-for-python

## Generate API key
* Log in to your account at StrexConnect at https://www.strexconnect.no
* Select "API KEYS" from the top menu
* Click "Add api key" and enter a name
* Click "Save"
* Copy the "API key" string

## Setup
### Authorization
* Add a header called "X-ApiKey" with the key from above to your requests.

### Swagger
* Swagger for the API is located here: https://test.target365.io/api/swagger.json
    * https://generator.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftest.target365.io%2Fapi%2Fswagger.json

### Reverse a Strex payment transaction
This example reverses a previously billed Strex payment transaction. The original transaction will not change, but a reversal transaction will be created that counters the previous transaction by a negative Price. The reversal is an asynchronous operation that usually takes a few seconds to finish.

#### Request
```
DELETE https://test.target365.io/api/strex/transactions/3202b85f-fac2-432a-8e55-a20ab8680211

```
</details>

#### Response
```
200 Ok

```

#### Response
```JSON
{
    "transactionId": "-3202b85f-fac2-432a-8e55-a20ab8680211"
}
```
#### Response codes
* 201	Strex transaction reversal has been registered and is processed asynchronously. Transaction id of the reversal transaction will be the same as the original transaction id prefixed with '-'.
* 401	Request was unauthorized.
* 404	Strex transaction not found.
* 409	Strex transaction is not reversable.

## One-click

Please note:

* The OneClick service will not stop same MSISDN to order several times as long as transactionID is unique. If end users order or subscribe several times to same service it's the merchants responsibility to refund the end user.

* Recurring billing is initiated by merchants, see section [Payment transactions](#payment-transactions) for more info.

* Since the one-click flow ends by redirecting the end user to an external merchant-controlled URL we recommend that merchants implement a mechanism to check status on all started transactions. If there’s any issue for the end user on their way to the last page they might have finished the payment, but not been able to get their product.

### One-click config
This example sets up a one-click config which makes it easier to handle campaigns in one-click where most properties like merchantId, price et cetera are known in advance. You can redirect the end-user to the one-click campaign page by redirecting to http://betal.strex.no/{YOUR-CONFIG-ID} for PROD and http://test-strex.target365.io/{YOUR-CONFIG-ID} for TEST-environment. You can also set the TransactionId by adding ?id={YOUR-TRANSACTION-ID} to the URL.

#### Request
```
PUT https://test.target365.io/api/one-click/configs/Test1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "configId": "Test1",
    "shortNumber": "2002",
    "price": 99,
    "merchantId": "YOUR_MERCHANT_ID",
    "serviceCode": "14002",
    "onlineText": "Buy directly",
    "offlineText": "Buy with PIN-code",
    "invoiceText": "Donation test",
    "redirectUrl": "https://your-return-url.com?id={TransactionId}",
    "recurring": true,
    "subscriptionInterval": "monthly",
    "subscriptionPrice": 99,
    "subscriptionStartSms": "Thanks for donating 99kr each month."
}
```

{TransactionId} in RedirectUrl is replaced by actual transaction id.

If Recurring is set to 'false', the following parameters are optional:

* SubscriptionInterval - Possible values are "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"

* SubscriptionPrice - How much the subscriber will be charged each interval

This parameter is optional:

* SubscriptionStartSms - SMS that will be sent to the user when subscription starts.

### Recurring transaction
This example sets up a recurring transaction for one-click. After creation you can immediately get the transaction to get the status code - the server will wait up to 20 seconds for the async transaction to complete.

## Encoding and SMS length
When sending SMS messages, we'll automatically send messages in the most compact encoding possible. If you include any non GSM-7 characters in your message body, we will automatically fall back to UCS-2 encoding (which will limit message bodies to 70 characters each).

Additionally, for long messages--greater than 160 GSM-7 characters or 70 UCS-2 characters--we will split the message into multiple segments. Six (6) bytes is also needed to instruct receiving device how to re-assemble messages, which for multi-segment messages, leaves 153 GSM-7 characters or 67 UCS-2 characters per segment.

Note that this may cause more message segments to be sent than you expect - a body with 152 GSM-7-compatible characters and a single unicode character will be split into three (3) messages because the unicode character changes the encoding into less-compact UCS-2. This will incur charges for three outgoing messages against your account.

Norwegian operators support different numbers of segments; Ice 16 segments, Telia 20 segments and Telenor 255 segments.
